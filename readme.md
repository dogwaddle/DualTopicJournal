## Two Drop Down Menus 

### Example One
First drop down, select Health
Second drop down, select Productivity

And then it pulls up a wiki page, with my thoughts on the intersection of health and productivity. 

### Example Two
First drop down, select Philosophy
Second drop down, select Neuroscience

Then it pulls up my thoughts on the intersection of the two. On the same page is recommended readings on the topics(Patricia Churchland) and a framework for learning it. A reccomended introduction to neuroscience book and introduction to philosophy book.
